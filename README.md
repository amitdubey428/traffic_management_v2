* The Deep Learning Yolov3 Darknet algorithm is used to detect the vehicle present on a particular lane and time is predicted using machine learning technique based on the number of vehicles present on that particular lane.    
* Hence, making the time allocation procedure dynamic for each lane depending on the traffic crowd of that lane and by this way the waiting time for other peoples on other lane is reduced.   
* The script is running on web server of Traffic Police and the data is sent to the traffic lights through cloud server.
